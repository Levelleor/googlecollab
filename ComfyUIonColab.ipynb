It also appears to run MUCH more slowly spiking CPU usage and causing jankiness and unresponsiveness, especially with large workflows. Personally I am not planning to use the new Nodes 2.0 and, unfortunately, am not able to invest the time to investigate and overhaul rgthree-comfy where needed. If you have issues when Nodes 2.0 is enabled, I'd urge you to switch it off as well and join me in hoping ComfyUI is not planning to deprecate the existing, stable canvas rendering all together.\n",

It also appears to run MUCH more slowly spiking CPU usage and causing jankiness and unresponsiveness, especially with large workflows. Personally I am not planning to use the new Nodes 2.0 and, unfortunately, am not able to invest the time to investigate and overhaul rgthree-comfy where needed. If you have issues when Nodes 2.0 is enabled, I'd urge you to switch it off as well and join me in hoping ComfyUI is not planning to deprecate the existing, stable canvas rendering all together.\n",
